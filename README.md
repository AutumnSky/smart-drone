## Free Advanced Java Course
I am the author of the [Advanced Java for adults course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-java-for-adults/?referralCode=8014CCF0A5A931ADED5F). This course contains advanced and not conventional lessons. In this course, you will learn to think differently from those who have a limited view of software development. I will provoke you to reflect on decisions that you take in your day to day job, which might not be the best ones. This course is for middle to senior developers and we will not teach Java language features but how to lead complex Java projects. 

This course's lectures are based on a Trading system, an opensource project hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/apssouza22/trading-system).
